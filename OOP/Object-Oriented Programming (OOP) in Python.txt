Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which are instances of classes. In Python, everything is an object, including numbers, strings, functions, and classes.

OOP allows you to model real-world entities and their interactions in your programs. It makes your code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.

Core Concepts of OOP:
Class and Object
Attributes and Methods
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism

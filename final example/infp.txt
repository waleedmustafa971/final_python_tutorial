following is a Python program that combines all the past topics, including:

Classes and OOP
Modules
File Handling (text, CSV, and JSON)
Exception Handling
Using Packages
Functions
This code will simulate a basic user management system, where users can be added, retrieved, and stored in files. The program will handle reading from and writing to text, CSV, and JSON files.

Directory Structure:

user_management/
    __init__.py
    user.py
    file_handler.py
main.py


.............................


Explanation of the Code:
User class (user.py):

This class models a user with attributes name, age, and occupation.
It includes a __repr__ method for easy string representation and a to_dict method to convert the user object to a dictionary (for JSON serialization).
FileHandler class (file_handler.py):

This class handles file operations for text, CSV, and JSON files.
It includes methods to read and write to files, handling exceptions like file not found.
main.py:

This is the main script where instances of the User class are created.
It demonstrates file handling by writing and reading data to/from text, CSV, and JSON files.
The script imports both User and FileHandler from their respective modules.
Execution Flow:
The program first creates user instances.
Then it writes user data to a text file, CSV file, and JSON file.
After that, it reads back the data from each file type and prints it to the console.

Advanced Algorithms
We'll begin with the fundamentals of algorithm design and analysis.

1. Introduction to Algorithms
What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or a set of rules to be followed in calculations or problem-solving operations, especially by a computer. It is a well-defined, finite sequence of instructions to solve a problem or perform a task.

Key Characteristics of Algorithms:
Definiteness: Each step of the algorithm should be clear and unambiguous.
Input: The algorithm must have 0 or more well-defined inputs.
Output: The algorithm should produce at least one output.
Finiteness: The algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.
Effectiveness: The steps of the algorithm should be basic enough to be carried out, in principle, by a human using paper and pencil.
Algorithm Efficiency:
The efficiency of an algorithm is measured in terms of two factors:

Time Complexity: The amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size.
Space Complexity: The amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution.
Time complexity is often represented using Big O notation (e.g., O(n), O(log n), O(n^2)), which describes the upper bound on the running time.
